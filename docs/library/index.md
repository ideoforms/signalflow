At a given moment in time, the contents of the buffer will be equal to the past N seconds of the audio generated by `input`. This is useful for (e.g.) a visual display of a rolling waveform or LFO window. `downsample` can be used to downsample the input; for example, with `downsample` of 10, a 1-second buffer can be used to display 10 seconds of historical audio.
- **[SegmentPlayer](buffer/segmentplayer/index.md)**: Trigger segments of `buffer` at the given list of `onsets` positions, in seconds. `index` determines the index of the onset to play back at, which can also be passed as an argument to trigger(). `rate` determines the playback rate, and `clock` can be used to retrigger based on the output of another Node. If `continue_after_segment` is non-zero, playback will continue after the subsequent onset.

If `wrap` is true, grain playback can wrap around the end/start of the buffer.
