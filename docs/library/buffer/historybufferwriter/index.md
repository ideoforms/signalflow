title: HistoryBufferWriter node documentation
description: HistoryBufferWriter: Writes a rolling history buffer of a given duration. At a given moment in time, the contents of the buffer will be equal to the past N seconds of the audio generated by `input`. This is useful for (e.g.) a visual display of a rolling waveform or LFO window. `downsample` can be used to downsample the input; for example, with `downsample` of 10, a 1-second buffer can be used to display 10 seconds of historical audio.

# HistoryBufferWriter

```python
HistoryBufferWriter(buffer=None, input=0.0, downsample=1)
```

Writes a rolling history buffer of a given duration. At a given moment in time, the contents of the buffer will be equal to the past N seconds of the audio generated by `input`. This is useful for (e.g.) a visual display of a rolling waveform or LFO window. `downsample` can be used to downsample the input; for example, with `downsample` of 10, a 1-second buffer can be used to display 10 seconds of historical audio.
