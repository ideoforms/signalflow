# Sequencing

- **[ClockDivider](clockdivider/index.md)**: When given a `clock` input (e.g., an Impulse), divides the clock by the given `factor`. factor must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- **[Counter](counter/index.md)**: Count upwards from `min` to `max`, driven by `clock`.
- **[Euclidean](euclidean/index.md)**: Euclidean rhythm as described by Toussaint, with `sequence_length` (n) and `num_events` (k), driven by `clock`.
- **[FlipFlop](flipflop/index.md)**: Flips from 0/1 on each `clock`.
- **[ImpulseSequence](impulsesequence/index.md)**: Each time a `clock` or trigger is received, outputs the next value in `sequence`. At all other times, outputs zero.
- **[Index](index/index.md)**: Outputs the value in `list` corresponding to `index`.
- **[Latch](latch/index.md)**: Initially outputs 0. When a trigger is received at `set`, outputs 1. When a trigger is subsequently received at `reset`, outputs 0, until the next `set`.
- **[Sequence](sequence/index.md)**: Outputs the elements in `sequence`, incrementing position on each `clock`.
- **[TriggerMult](triggermult/index.md)**: Distribute any triggers to all output nodes.
- **[TriggerRoundRobin](triggerroundrobin/index.md)**: Relay trigger() events to a single node from the list of connected outputs, with `direction` determining the direction: 1 (or above) = move forwards by N, -1 = move backwards by N, 0 = stationary.
