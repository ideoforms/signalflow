# Patch

## Operators

The output of a Patch can be amplified, attenuated, combined, modulated and compared using Python operators, in much the same way as [Node](../node/operators.md):

```python
patch = Patch(patch_spec)
output = patch * 0.5
```

For a full list of the operators that can be applied to a `Patch`, see [Node operators](../node/operators.md).
