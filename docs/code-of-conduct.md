# Code of Conduct

SignalFlow tutorials and workshop events follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

The aim of the SignalFlow project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

## Reporting unacceptable behaviour

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour at a SignalFlow workshop or tutorial, including intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions, please contact the community organiser, who may take any action appropriate to remedy the behaviour.

Please reach out to the workshop organiser or the [project coordinator](https://danieljohnjones.com/contact/), who will provide assistance. 

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
