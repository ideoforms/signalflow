    - Graphs, Nodes, Buffers, Patches
 - Getting Started
 - Nodes
    - Inputs
    - Channel upmixing
    - Triggers
    - Buffers
    - Monitoring node status
    - Chance and stochastic nodes
    - Node class reference
 - AudioGraph
   - Global configuration
   - Graph status
   - Recording the audio output
 - Buffers
   - Why called before? Because can store (e.g.) control data, not just audio

   - Interpolation
   - Creating buffers
     - From a sound file
     - From a sample array
     - From a function
   - Recording to buffers
     - Audio data
     - Control data
   - Saving buffers
   - Reading buffer data
